<h1>Health is Wealth Gallery</h1>
<p>Not only is our good good looking, it's health for you as well! A lot of people who come to our fitness center don't know what to eat 
after their workout until they see our food court. We have some photos of what you can expect below.</p>
<h2>Baked Foods</h2>

<h3>Our Healthy Burgers</h3>

Hearty, satisfying, and flavor-packed, this homemade veggie burger, whether cooked on the grill or in a frying pan, can hold its shape. Crispy on the outside, soft and textured on the inside, the black beluga lentils give the patty that grainy texture.<br>
<h4>Fresh Fish Meal</h4>

Our chef makes it his mission to always aquire and serve the freshest fish possible, our salmon with veggies and a lime for that extra zest.</br>
